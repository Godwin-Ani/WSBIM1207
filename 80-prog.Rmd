# Additional programming concepts

More advanced data analyses techniques require some additional
programming kills, that will be introdcuced in this section, and
demonstrate using high troughput omics data.

## Conditionals

`if` and `else`.

## Iteration

`for` loops and `apply` functions.

Example: iteration over files.

## Writing clean code

Writing clean code means writing easily readable code, hence easily
understable code and, eventually code with less bugs.

Defensive programming


## Writing new functions

A function is composed of a name, inputs (inside the parenthesis), a
body (between curly brackets) and an ouput (last statement or variably
indise the `return` statement).

```{r myfun}
my_fun <- function(x, y) {
    message("First input: ", x)
    message("Second input: ", y)
    z <- x * abs(y)
    return(z)
}
my_fun(2, -5)
```
