# Reproducible research

For a general introduction on the topic in French, see @Pouzat:2015.

## Working reproducibly

Possibly explain briefly the different types of preproducibility.

Useful reference: @Markowetz:2015.

## `knitr` and `rmarkdown`

Reproducible research is an essential part of any data analysis. With
the tools that are available, one can argue that it has become more
difficult not to produce reproducible reports than to producing then.

Reproducible documents have been a part of R since the very
beginning. See for example @biocwp2, to see how such *compendia* play a
central role within the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/)
project (more about Bioconductor in it's dedicated
chapter). Originally, these were written in LaTeX, interleaved with R
code chunks, forming so called Sweave documents (with extension
`.Rnw`).

More recently, it has become to use the
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax
markup language, rather than LaTeX. Once interleaved with R code
chunks, these documents become Rmarkdown files (`.Rmd`). The can be
converted into markdown using `knitr::knit`, that executes the code
chunk and incorporates their output in the resulting markdown
documents, which itself is converted to one of many output formats,
typically pdf of html using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). I R, this
final conversion is done using `rmarkdown::render` (that relies on
pandoc). The [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package is
developed and maintained by RStudio and benefits from excellent
documentation, support and integrates into the RStudio editor.

RStudio now also support *R Notebook* documents[^jupyter] that execute
individual code chunks that are displayed directly in the source
document.

[^jupyter]: See also [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
initially developed for Python, but that can run R code as well.

## Additional features

- Among the most options that can set for code chunks is
  `cache`. Setting `cache=TRUE` will avoid that specific code chunk to
  be cached and not recomputed every time the documented in *knitted*,
  unless the code chunk was modified. This is an important feature
  when long computations are necessary.

- The `DT::datatable` function allows to create dynamic tables
  directly from R, as show below.

```{r dtexample}
ip <- installed.packages()
DT::datatable(ip)
```

- It is always useful to finish a Rmarkdown report with a section
  providing all the session information details with the
  `sessionInfo()` function, such at the end of this material. This
  allows readers to review the version of R itself and all the
  packages that were used to produce the report.

> **Challenge**
>
> Prepare an Rmarkdown report summarising the portal ecology data. The
> report should include a *Material and methods* section where the
> data is read in (ideally from the online file) and briefly
> described, a *Data preparation* section where rows with missing
> values are filtered out, and a *Visualisation* section where one or
> two plots are rendered. Finish your report with a *Session
> information* section.
