# Preamble {-}

The [WSBIM1207](https://uclouvain.be/cours-2018-wsbim1207.html) course
is an introduction to bioinformatics (and data science) for biology
and biomedical students. It introduces bioinformatics methodology and
technologies without requiring any prerequisites. The aim of this
course is that students should be in a position to understand
important notions of bioinformatics and tackle simple
bioinformatics-related problems in R, in particular to develope simple
R analysis scripts and reproducible analysis reports to interogate,
visualise and understand data in a tidy tabular format.

The course will be followed by *Bioinformatics*
([WSBIM1322](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/WSBIM1322)) and *Omics
data analysis*
([WSBIM2122](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/WSBIM2122)).

## Motivation {-}

It is interesting to start this course by asking the students[^qst], who
have likely not yet been exposed to bioinformatics

> What is bioinformatics?

[^qst]: The same question will be asked at the very end of the course.

While [Wikipedia
defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) it as

> Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods
  and software tools for understanding biological data.

this course will focus on the doing, rather than on knowing
definitions. Hence, the material and how it is taught will be focused
on practice.

## References

References are provided throughout the course. Several stand out
however, as they cover large parts of the material or provide
complementary resources.

The material for the first chapters, covering the *Introduction to
data science with R*, is based on the [Data Carpentry Ecology
curiculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop).

General references for this course are *R for Data Science*
[@r4ds:2015] and *Bioinformatics Data Skills* [@Buffalo:2015].
