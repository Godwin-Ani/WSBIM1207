# Bioinformatics {#sec:bioinfo}

As already alluded to ealier, [Wikipedia
defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) bioinformatics
as

> Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods
  and software tools for understanding biological data.

Bioinformatics is as varied as biology itself, and ranges from data
analysis, to software development, computational or statistical
methodological development, more theoretical work, as well as any
combination of these.

## Omics data

So far, we have explored broad data science techniques in R. A
widespread and successful area of bioinfomatics, and one that you, as
a biology or biomedical science student are likely to be confronted
with, is the analysis and interpretation of omics data.

```{r infoflow, results='markup', fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Information flow in biological systems (Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology)).", fig.width=7, fig.height=7, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/Centraldogma_nodetails.png")
```

It is useful to define these omics data along the flow of information
in biology (Figure \@ref(fig:infoflow)), and define the different
application domains. The technologies that focus on DNA, and the
genome in particular (either whole or parts thereof) are termed
**genomics**, and are currently based on sequencing, in particular
high throughput sequencing (HTS). The domain focusing on the study of
any DNA modification (such as for example methylation) is termed
**epigenetics**. The study of RNA, and more specifically the
quantitation of RNA levels in biological samples is termed
**transcriptomics**, as it assays the transcription of DNA into RNA
molecules. Without further specification, transcriptomics refers to
the quantitation of messanger RNA, although one could also focus on
non-coding RNAs such as micro RNAs. HTS is currently the technology of
choice for any transcriptomics study, while a decade ago, prior to the
development of RNA sequencing (called **RNAseq**), microarrays were
widely used. **Proteomics** focuses on the identification and
quantitation of proteins, and can also expand into the study of
protein interactions, post-translational modifications or sub-cellular
localisation of proteins. Further downstreams of proteins, small
molecules or lipids can also be assayed under the umbrella terms of
**metabolomics** and **lipidomics**. The technology of choice for
protein, lipids or smaller metabolites is mass spectrometry.

Important concepts

- high throughput
- raw data
- processed data
- metadata, including experimental design (see also stats course)

Reminder about reproducible research, and need for raw data and
complete processing script to reproduce the processed data and
results.

## Objects

Data in bioinformatics is often more complex than the basic data types
we have seen so far. Give a short introduction and example to some
relevant object.

## Documentation

Documenting ones tasks in a bioinformatics project is absolutely
essential. It is akin a lab notebook for wet lab.
