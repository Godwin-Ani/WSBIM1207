## Local installation

This section describes how to install R, Rstudio, and a set of
important packages for the course.

1. Download R from the CRAN page:
   [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/). At
   the top of that page, choose the *Download R* link corresponding to
   your operating system. 
   
   If you use Windows, follow *install R for the first time*, then
   click the link to download R. The installation procedure is like
   any other software, and you can safely use all default options.
   
   If you use Mac (OS X), download the *pkg* installer that matches
   you OS version and install like any other software
   
   Linux users are advised to use their package manager.
   
2. Download and install the Rstudio Desktop Open source edition:
   [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Choose
   the installer for your operating system and version. Install as any
   other software.

3. Start Rstudio and install the following packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "remotes", "devtools"))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("UCLouvain-CBIO/rWSBIM1207")
```

If during any of the package installation steps, you get asked to
update some packages, for example with a message like 

```
Old packages: 'tinytex', 'TSP', 'tximeta', 'umap', 'vctrs', 'waveslim',
  'xcms', 'xlsx', 'xml2'
Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]: 
```

You can answer `a` to update all your packages.

4. To be able to compile Rmd files into pdf, you will also need to
   install an additional software. On Windows, you will need to
   install the **full** version of
   [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). See the
   [tutorial](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex) for detailed
   steps. See also [this
   post](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9)
   for details. For Max OSX, you will need to install
   [MacTeX](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9). [This
   post](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-macos-high-sierra-e7b5705c9fd)
   provides details. For linux, use your package manager to install
   the tex-live suite.

   Compilation to html will not require any additional installations
   and can also be used.

## Using a cloud R/RStudio instance

An alternative to local installation is to use *virtual machines* that
run in the cloud. Here, we will use Renku platform provided by the
Swiss Data Science Center.

1. Create a new renku user - click to *Login - Sign up* button on
   [https://renkulab.io/](https://renkulab.io/), click *Register* at
   the bottom of the login screen and follow instructions. 
   
   Once completed, you will get to the following (or similar) screen.
   
```{r, fig.cap = "Renky labding page.", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/renku_screen1.png")
```
