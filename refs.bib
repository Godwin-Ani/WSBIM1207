		  but important, component of data cleaning: data
		  tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model
		  and visualize, and have a specific structure: each
		  variable is a column, each observation is a row, and
		  each type of observational unit is a table. This
		  framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets
		  because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
		  with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This
		  structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools
		  for data analysis, tools that both input and output
		  tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data
		  structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a
		  case study free from mundane data manipulation
		  chores.},
