# Conclusions

In this course, we have seen the importance of structure data. Good
data structure starts with simple, tidy tabular data, whether it is
manually encoded in spreadsheet, or handled in R as dataframes or
tibbles. More complex data, that doesn't fit in tabular data, can be
modelled into dedicated objects that display specialised
behaviour. Structured data allows us to reason on that data, without
having to look it at. Reason and generalisation of data in turn allows
to manipulate and visualise it, i.e. to explore, analyse and
understand it. The cherry on the data analysis cake is to be able to
reproduce an analysis, either oneself or share it in a way that other
can.

As mentioned in the preamble, the goal of this course is obviously not
for students that take it to qualify as bioinformaticians at the
end. However, what is important is to appreciate the importance of
data and their analysis, and to become fluent in exploring, discussing
and communicating around data. A shared appreciation of data and their
complexity will hopefully reduce the distinction between
bioinformaticians and experimental scientists. Indeed, at the end of
the end, it's useful to remember that

> We are all biologists, in that we study biology. Some use wet lab,
> others dry lab techniques.

## Next steps

- Statistics and machine learning (your statis courses and some of it
  in [WSBIM1322](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/WSBIM1322)).
- getting better at programming and data analysis (Advanced R).
- evolving scripts into tools/packages (R packages).
- other tools: unix command line and git (provide refs)
- omics data analysis ([WSBIM2122](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/WSBIM2122)).
