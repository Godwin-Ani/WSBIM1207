<p>Reproducible research refers to research that can be reproduced under
various conditions and by different people. It applies to every area
of research, both experimental and computational, but is often (but
not always) easier to implement for computational work. The different
levels of reproducibility can formalised<label for="tufte-sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">13</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">13</span> The nomenclature is taken from <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/">this blog
post</a> that
provides links and highlights that confusion that exists around
the terms and concepts of reproducibility.</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Repeat</strong> my experiment, i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results
using the same setup (data, software, …) in the same lab or on the
same computer. That’s basically re-running one of my analysis some
time after I original developed it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reproduce</strong> an experiment (not ones own), i.e. obtain the same
tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
using the same setup (the data would be downloaded from a public
repository and the same software, but possibly using a different
version, or a different operation system).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replicate</strong> an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
tables/graphs/results in a different set up. The data could still be
downloaded from the public repository, or possibly
re-generated/re-simulated, and the analysis would be re-implemented
based on the original description.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, <strong>re-use</strong> the information/knowledge from one experiment to
run a different experiment with the aim to <strong>confirm</strong> results from
scratch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The table below summerised these concepts focusing on data and code in
computational projects.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to work reproducibly, and <span class="citation"><label for="tufte-mn-25" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-25" class="margin-toggle">Markowetz (2015)<span class="marginnote">Markowetz, Florian. 2015. <span>“Five Selfish Reasons to Work Reproducibly.”</span> <em>Genome Biology</em> 16 (1): 274. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7</a>.</span></span>

<p>Reproducible research is an essential part of any data analysis. With
the tools that are available, one can argue that it has become more
difficult not to produce reproducible reports than to producing then.</p>
<p>Reproducible documents have been a part of R since the very
beginning. See for example <span class="citation"><label for="tufte-mn-26" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-26" class="margin-toggle">R. Gentleman and Temple Lang (2004)<span class="marginnote">Gentleman, Robert, and Duncan Temple Lang. 2004. <span>“Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research.”</span> <em>Bioconductor Project Working Papers. Working Paper 2</em>. <a href="https://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2">https://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2</a>.</span></span>, to see how such <em>compendia</em> play a
central role within the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>
project (more about Bioconductor in it’s dedicated
chapter). Originally, these were written in LaTeX, interleaved with R
code chunks, forming so called Sweave documents (with extension
<code>.Rnw</code>).</p>
<p>

<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>More recently, it has become to use the
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> syntax
markup language, rather than LaTeX. Once interleaved with R code
chunks, these documents become <strong>Rmarkdown</strong> files (<code>.Rmd</code>). The can be
converted into markdown using <code>knitr::knit</code>, that executes the code
chunk and incorporates their output in the resulting markdown
documents, which itself is converted to one of many output formats,
typically pdf of html using <a href="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. In R, this
final conversion is done using <code>rmarkdown::render</code> (that relies on
pandoc).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>knitr::knit</code> converts the <code>Rmd</code> into <code>md</code> by executing the code
chunks and replacing the code by its output (text, tables, figures,
…).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>md</code> file is then compiled into the desired <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html">output
format</a> (typically html
or pdf) using <code>pandoc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>In practice, in R, these two steps are automatically handled in one
go by <code>rmarkdown::render()</code>.</p></li>

<p>The <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">rmarkdown</a> package is developed
and maintained by RStudio and benefits from excellent documentation,
support and integrates into the RStudio editor.</p>
<p>An Rmarkdown document is composed of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An optional YAML <strong>header</strong>, delimited by <code>---</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Text in <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">simple <strong>markdown</strong>
format</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One or more R <strong>code chunks</strong> delimited by three backticks. Each
code chunk can be uniquely named and parametrised with a set of code
chunk <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/options/">options</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These respective parts of an <code>Rmd</code> file are show below and will be
demonstrated during the course.</p>
<p><img src="figs/rmd.png"></p>
<p>RStudio also supports

<li>It is always useful to finish a Rmarkdown report with a section
providing all the session information details with the
<code>sessionInfo()</code> function, such at the end of this material. This
allows readers to review the version of R itself and all the
packages that were used to produce the report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Rmarkdown, it is also possible to produce
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html">slides</a>,
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html">websites</a>, and

<div class="question-body">
<p>Prepare an Rmarkdown report summarising the portal ecology data. The
report should include a <em>Material and methods</em> section where the data
is read in (ideally from the online file) and briefly described, a
<em>Data preparation</em> section where rows with missing values are filtered
out, and a <em>Visualisation</em> section where one or two plots are
rendered. Finish your report with a <em>Session information</em> section.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf">R Markdown Cheat
Sheet</a>
and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf">Reference
Guide</a>
will help you with the markdown synatax, R code chunk options, and
RStudio utlisation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you prepare an <code>Rmd</code> report, it is advised to start
with a code chunk that load all packages, and update that code chunk
as you proceed with your analysis and use new packages. This avoids
the situation where some commands work in your R console (where you
initially loaded the package) but fail when you compile your
report. Indeed, an <code>Rmd</code> file is compiled in a new, clean R session,
without access to your working session, the packages that were loaded,
and the variables that were created.</p>

<p>There are other tools for reproducible research, that aim to
disseminate more than code and data. Docker containers for example
enable to share the complete image of an operating system, including
all system dependencies and software/data to repeat a complete
analysis. These are useful tools, even though their aren’t necessarily
ideal, and beyond the aim of this course. In the annex, (chapter
<a href="sec-anx.html#sec-anx">12</a>), we show how to use a pre-build course-specific
RStudio cloud instance based on the <a href="https://renkulab.io/">Renku</a>

<p>To test if your report is fully reproducible, uniquely name the <code>Rmd</code>
