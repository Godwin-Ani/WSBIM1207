MOOC is of interest.</p>
<p>Reproducible research refers to research that can be reproduced under
various conditions and by different people. It applies to every area
of research, both experimental and computational, but is often (but
not always) easier to implement for computational work. The different
levels of reproducibility can formalised<label for="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">12</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">12</span> The nomenclature is taken from <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/">this blog
post</a> that
provides links and highlights that confusion that exists around
the terms and concepts of reproducibility.</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Repeat</strong> my experiment, i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results
using the same setup (data, software, …) in the same lab or on the
same computer. That’s basically re-running one of my analysis some
time after I original developed it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reproduce</strong> an experiment (not ones own), i.e. obtain the same
tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
using the same setup (the data would be downloaded from a public
repository and the same software, but possibly using a different
version, or a different operation system).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replicate</strong> an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
tables/graphs/results in a different set up. The data could still be
downloaded from the public repository, or possibly
re-generated/re-simulated, and the analysis would be re-implemented
based on the original description.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, <strong>re-use</strong> the information/knowledge from one experiment to
run a different experiment with the aim to <strong>confirm</strong> results from
scratch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The table below summerised these concepts focusing on data and code in
computational projects.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to work reproducibly, and <span class="citation">Markowetz (<a href="session-information.html#ref-Markowetz:2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>
nicely summarises 5 good reasons. Importantly, he stressed out that
the first beneficiary of reproducible work are the student/research
that apply these principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster.</li>
<li>Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers<label for="tufte-sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">13</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">13</span> And course reports!

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> <code>knitr</code> and <code>rmarkdown</code></h2>
<p>Reproducible research is an essential part of any data analysis. With
the tools that are available, one can argue that it has become more
difficult not to produce reproducible reports than to producing then.</p>
<p>Reproducible documents have been a part of R since the very
beginning. See for example <span class="citation">R. Gentleman and Temple Lang (<a href="session-information.html#ref-biocwp2" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, to see how such <em>compendia</em> play a
central role within the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>
project (more about Bioconductor in it’s dedicated
chapter). Originally, these were written in LaTeX, interleaved with R
code chunks, forming so called Sweave documents (with extension
<code>.Rnw</code>).</p>
<p>More recently, it has become to use the
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> syntax
markup language, rather than LaTeX. Once interleaved with R code
chunks, these documents become Rmarkdown files (<code>.Rmd</code>). The can be
converted into markdown using <code>knitr::knit</code>, that executes the code
chunk and incorporates their output in the resulting markdown
documents, which itself is converted to one of many output formats,
typically pdf of html using <a href="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. In R, this
final conversion is done using <code>rmarkdown::render</code> (that relies on
pandoc). The <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">rmarkdown</a> package is
developed and maintained by RStudio and benefits from excellent
documentation, support and integrates into the RStudio editor.</p>
<p><img src="figs/rmd.png" /></p>
<p>RStudio now also support <em>R Notebook</em> documents<label for="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">15</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">15</span> See also <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>
initially developed for Python, but that can run R code as well.</span> that execute
individual code chunks that are displayed directly in the source
document.</p>

<div id="additional-features" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Additional features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Among the most options that can set for code chunks is
<code>cache</code>. Setting <code>cache=TRUE</code> will avoid that specific code chunk to
be cached and not recomputed every time the documented in <em>knitted</em>,
unless the code chunk was modified. This is an important feature
when long computations are necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>DT::datatable</code> function allows to create dynamic tables
directly from R, as show below.</p></li>

<li>It is always useful to finish a Rmarkdown report with a section
providing all the session information details with the
<code>sessionInfo()</code> function, such at the end of this material. This
allows readers to review the version of R itself and all the
packages that were used to produce the report.</li>

<div class="question-body">
<p>Prepare an Rmarkdown report summarising the portal ecology data. The
report should include a <em>Material and methods</em> section where the data
is read in (ideally from the online file) and briefly described, a
<em>Data preparation</em> section where rows with missing values are filtered
out, and a <em>Visualisation</em> section where one or two plots are
rendered. Finish your report with a <em>Session information</em> section.</p>

<p>There are other tools for reproducible research, that aim to
disseminate more than code and data. Docker containers for example
enable to share the complete image of an operating system, including
all system dependencies and software/data to repeat a complete
analysis. These are useful tools, even though their aren’t necessarily
ideal, and beyond the aim of this course.</p>

<p>Repeat the <em>Beer consumption</em> analysis using the that was done in
chapters <a href="sec-dplyr.html#sec:dplyr">4</a> and <a href="sec-vis.html#sec:vis">5</a>.</p>
<p>To test if your report is fully reproducible, uniquely name the <code>Rmd</code>
file as <code>surname_surname_beers_report.Rmd</code>, post it on the course
forum and ask your neighbour to download it, compile it into pdf and
provide feedback on whether the document was reproducible and easy to
follow<label for="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">16</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">16</span> This is an important exercise, as it will mimic the exam
situation, where you will hand in your <code>Rmd</code> reports that will
need to be compiled (to pdf) before marking. In addition, it
demonstrates the challenges of writing and reproducing an
understandable and reproducible document.</span>.</p>
