</ul>
<p>Good data organization is the foundation of your research
project. Most researchers have data or do data entry in
spreadsheets. Spreadsheet programs are very useful graphical
interfaces for designing data tables and handling very basic data
quality control functions.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Spreadsheet outline</h3>
<p>After this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement best practices in data table formatting</li>
<li>Identify and address common formatting mistakes</li>
<li>Understand approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets</li>
<li>Utilize basic quality control features and data manipulation practices</li>
<li>Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Spreadsheets are good for data entry. Therefore we have a lot of data
in spreadsheets. Much of your time as a researcher will be spent in
this ‘data wrangling’ stage. It’s not the most fun, but it’s
necessary. We’ll teach you how to think about data organization and
some practices for more effective data wrangling.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Why aren’t we teaching data analysis in spreadsheets</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Data analysis in spreadsheets usually requires a lot of manual
work. If you want to change a parameter or run an analysis with a
new dataset, you usually have to redo everything by hand. (We do
know that you can create macros, but see the next point.)</p></li>

analyses done in spreadsheet programs when you want to go back to
your work or someone asks for details of your analysis.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Spreadsheet programs</h3>
<p>Many spreadsheet programs are available. Since most participants utilize Excel as their primary spreadsheet program, this lesson will make use of Excel examples.</p>
<p>A free spreadsheet program that can also be used is LibreOffice</p>
<p>Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general idea
is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>
- How many people have used spreadsheets in their research?
- How many people have accidentally done something that made them
frustrated or sad?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spreadsheets encompass a lot of the things we need to be able to do as
researchers. We can use them for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data entry</li>
<li>Organizing data</li>
<li>Subsetting and sorting data</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Plotting</li>
</ul>
<p>We do a lot of different operations in spreadsheets. What kind of operations do you do in spreadsheets? Which ones do you think spreadsheets are good for?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="problems-with-spreadsheets" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Problems with Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>Spreadsheets are good for data entry, but in reality we tend to
use spreadsheet programs for much more than data entry. We use them
to create data tables for publications, to generate summary
statistics, and make figures.</p>
<p>Generating tables for publications in a spreadsheet is not
optimal - often, when formatting a data table for publication, we’re
reporting key summary statistics in a way that is not really meant to
be read as data, and often involves special formatting
(merging cells, creating borders, making it pretty). We advise you to
do this sort of operation within your document editing software.</p>
<p>The latter two applications, generating statistics and figures, should
be used with caution: because of the graphical, drag and drop nature of
spreadsheet programs, it can be very difficult, if not impossible, to
replicate your steps (much less retrace anyone else’s), particularly if your
stats or figures require you to do more complex calculations. Furthermore,
in doing calculations in a spreadsheet, it’s easy to accidentally apply a
slightly different formula to multiple adjacent cells. When using a
command-line based statistics program like R or SAS, it’s practically
impossible to apply a calculation to one observation in your
dataset but not another unless you’re doing it on purpose.</p>
<div id="using-spreadsheets-for-data-entry-and-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Using Spreadsheets for Data Entry and Cleaning</h3>
<p>However, there are circumstances where you might want to use a spreadsheet
program to produce “quick and dirty” calculations or figures, and data
cleaning will help you use some of these features. Data cleaning also
puts your data in a better format prior to importation into a
statistical analysis program. We will show you how to use some features of
spreadsheet programs to check your data quality along the way and produce
preliminary summary statistics.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will assume that you are most likely using Excel as
your primary spreadsheet program - there are others (gnumeric, Calc
from OpenOffice), and their functionality is similar, but Excel seems
to be the program most used by biologists and ecologists.</p>

<div id="formatting-data-tables-in-spreadsheets" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Formatting data tables in spreadsheets</h2>
<p>Questions:
- How do we format data in spreadsheets for effective data use?</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe best practices for data entry and formatting in spreadsheets.</li>
<li>Apply best practices to arrange variables and observations in a spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keypoints:
- Never modify your raw data. Always make a copy before making any changes.
- Keep track of all of the steps you take to clean your data in a plain text file.
- Organize your data according to tidy data principles.</p>
<p>The most common mistake made is treating spreadsheet programs like lab
notebooks, that is, relying on context, notes in the margin, spatial
layout of data and fields to convey information. As humans, we can
(usually) interpret these things, but computers don’t view information
the same way, and unless we explain to the computer what every single
thing means (and that can be hard!), it will not be able to see how
our data fits together.</p>
<p>Using the power of computers, we can manage and analyze data in much
more effective and faster ways, but to use that power, we have to set
up our data for the computer to be able to understand it (and
computers are very literal).</p>
<p>This is why it’s extremely important to set up well-formatted tables
from the outset - before you even start entering data from your very
first preliminary experiment. Data organization is the foundation of
your research project. It can make it easier or harder to work with
your data throughout your analysis, so it’s worth thinking about when
you’re doing your data entry or setting up your experiment. You can
set things up in different ways in spreadsheets, but some of these
choices can limit your ability to work with the data in other programs
or have the you-of-6-months-from-now or your collaborator work with
the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the best layouts/formats (as well as software and interfaces)
for data entry and data analysis might be different. It is important
to take this into account, and ideally automate the conversion from
one to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="keeping-track-of-your-analyses" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Keeping track of your analyses</h3>
<p>When you’re working with spreadsheets, during data clean up or
analyses, it’s very easy to end up with a spreadsheet that looks very
different from the one you started with. In order to be able to
reproduce your analyses or figure out what you did when Reviewer #3
asks for a different analysis, you should</p>
<ul>
<li><p>create a new file with your cleaned or analyzed data. Don’t modify
the original dataset, or you will never know where you started!</p></li>
<li><p>keep track of the steps you took in your clean up or analysis. You
should track these steps as you would any step in an experiment. We
recommend that you do this in a plain text file stored in the same
folder as the data file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This might be an example of a spreadsheet setup:</p>
<p><img src="figs/spreadsheet-setup-updated.png" /></p>
<p>Put these principles in to practice today during your Exercises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This is out of scope for this lesson, but for information on
how to maintain version control over your data, look at our lesson
on <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">‘Git’</a>.</p>

<div id="structuring-data-in-spreadsheets" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Structuring data in spreadsheets</h3>
<p>The cardinal rules of using spreadsheet programs for data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put all your variables in columns - the thing you’re measuring,
like ‘weight’ or ‘temperature’.</li>
<li>Put each observation in its own row.</li>
<li>Don’t combine multiple pieces of information in one
cell. Sometimes it just seems like one thing, but think if that’s
the only way you’ll want to be able to use or sort that data.</li>
<li>Leave the raw data raw - don’t change it!</li>
<li>Export the cleaned data to a text-based format like CSV
(comma-separated values) format. This ensures that anyone can use
the data, and is required by most data repositories.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, we have data from a survey of small mammals in a desert
ecosystem. Different people have gone to the field and entered data
into a spreadsheet. They keep track of things like species, plot,
weight, sex and date collected.</p>
<p>If they were to keep track of the data like this:</p>
<p><img src="figs/multiple-info.png" /></p>
<p>the problem is that species and sex are in the same field. So, if they wanted to
look at all of one species or look at different weight distributions by sex,
it would be hard to do this using this data setup. If instead we put sex and species
in different columns, you can see that it would be much easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="columns-for-variables-and-rows-for-observations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Columns for variables and rows for observations</h3>
<p>The rule of thumb, when setting up a datasheet, is columns =
variables, rows = observations, cells = data (values).</p>
<p>So, instead we should have:</p>
<p><img src="figs/single-info.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>If not already discussed, introduce the dataset that will be used in
this lesson, and in the other ecology lessons, the <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/data/">Portal Project
Teaching
Dataset</a>.</p>
<p>The data used in the ecology lessons are observations of a small
mammal community in southern Arizona. This is part of a project
studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant community that
has been running for almost 40 years. The rodents are sampled on a
series of 24 plots, with different experimental manipulations
controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.</p>
<p>This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100
publications. We’ve simplified it just a little bit for the
workshop, but you can download the full dataset and work with it
using exactly the same tools we’ll learn about today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>We’re going to take a messy version of the survey data and describe how we would clean it up.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download the data by clicking
<a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083">here</a> to get it
from FigShare.</li>
<li>Open up the data in a spreadsheet program.</li>
<li>You can see that there are two tabs. Two field assistants
conducted the surveys, one in 2013 and one in 2014, and they both
kept track of the data in their own way. Now you’re the person in
charge of this project and you want to be able to start analyzing
the data.</li>
<li>With the person next to you, identify what is wrong with this
spreadsheet. Also discuss the steps you would need to take to clean
up the 2013 and 2014 tabs, and to put them all together in one
spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important</strong> Do not forget our first piece of advice: to
create a new file (or tab) for the cleaned data, never
modify your original (raw) data.</p>
<p>After you go through this exercise, we’ll discuss as a group what was wrong
with this data and how you would fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take about 10 minutes to work on this exercise.</li>
<li>All the mistakes in <a href="../02-common-mistakes">02-common-mistakes</a>
are present in the messy dataset. If the exercise is done during a
workshop, ask people what they saw as wrong with the data. As they
bring up different points, you can refer to
<a href="../02-common-mistakes">02-common-mistakes</a> or expand a bit on the
point they brought up.</li>
<li>If you get a response where they’ve fixed the date, you can pause
and go to the <a href="../03-dates-as-data">03-dates-as-data</a> lesson. Or
you can say you’ll come back to dates at the end.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Common Spreadsheet Errors</h2>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are some common challenges with formatting data in spreadsheets
and how can we avoid them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives:
- Recognize and resolve common spreadsheet formatting problems.</p>
<p>Keypoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using multiple tables within one spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Avoid spreading data across multiple tabs.</li>
<li>Record zeros as zeros.</li>
<li>Use an appropriate null value to record missing data.</li>
<li>Don’t use formatting to convey information or to make your spreadsheet look pretty.</li>
<li>Place comments in a separate column.</li>
<li>Record units in column headers.</li>
<li>Include only one piece of information in a cell.</li>
<li>Avoid spaces, numbers and special characters in column headers.</li>
<li>Avoid special characters in your data.</li>
<li>Record metadata in a separate plain text file.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson is meant to be used as a reference for discussion as
learners identify issues with the messy dataset discussed in the
previous lesson. Instructors: don’t go through this lesson except to
refer to responses to the exercise in the previous lesson.</p>
<p>There are a few potential errors to be on the lookout for in your own
data as well as data from collaborators or the Internet. If you are
aware of the errors and the possible negative effect on downstream
data analysis and result interpretation, it might motivate yourself
and your project members to try and avoid them. Making small changes
to the way you format your data in spreadsheets, can have a great
impact on efficiency and reliability when it comes to data cleaning
and analysis.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Using multiple tables</h3>
<p>A common strategy is creating multiple data tables within
one spreadsheet. This confuses the computer, so don’t do this!
When you create multiple tables within one
spreadsheet, you’re drawing false associations between things for the computer,
which sees each row as an observation. You’re also potentially using the same
field name in multiple places, which will make it harder to clean your data up
into a usable form. The example below depicts the problem:</p>
<p><img src="figs/2_datasheet_example.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the example above, the computer will see (for example) row 4 and assume that all columns A-AF
refer to the same sample. This row actually represents four distinct samples
(sample 1 for each of four different collection dates - May 29th, June 12th, June 19th, and June 26th),
as well as some calculated summary statistics (an average (avr) and standard error of measurement (SEM)) for two of those samples. Other rows are similarly problematic.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabs" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Using multiple tabs</h3>
<p>But what about workbook tabs? That seems like an easy way to organize
data, right? Well, yes and no. When you create extra tabs, you fail to
allow the computer to see connections in the data that are there (you
have to introduce spreadsheet application-specific functions or
scripting to ensure this connection). Say, for instance, you make a
separate tab for each day you take a measurement.</p>
<p>This isn’t good practice for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>you are more likely to accidentally add inconsistencies to your
data if each time you take a measurement, you start recording data
in a new tab, and</p></li>
<li><p>even if you manage to prevent all inconsistencies from creeping in,
you will add an extra step for yourself before you analyze the data
because you will have to combine these data into a single
datatable. You will have to explicitly tell the computer how to
combine tabs - and if the tabs are inconsistently formatted, you
might even have to do it manually.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The next time you’re entering data, and you go to create another tab
or table, ask yourself if you could avoid adding this tab by adding
another column to your original spreadsheet. We used multiple tabs in
our example of a messy data file, but now you’ve seen how you can
reorganize your data to consolidate across tabs.</p>
<p>Your data sheet might get very long over the course of the
experiment. This makes it harder to enter data if you can’t see your
headers at the top of the spreadsheet. But don’t repeat your header
row. These can easily get mixed into the data, leading to problems
down the road.</p>
<p>Instead you can freeze the column headers so that they remain visible even when you have a spreadsheet with many rows.</p>

<div id="zeros" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Not filling in zeros</h2>
<p>It might be that when you’re measuring something, it’s usually a zero,
say the number of times a rabbit is observed in the survey. Why bother
writing in the number zero in that column, when it’s mostly zeros?</p>
<p>However, there’s a difference between a zero and a blank cell in a
spreadsheet. To the computer, a zero is actually data. You measured or
counted it. A blank cell means that it wasn’t measured and the
computer will interpret it as an unknown value (otherwise known as a
null value).</p>
<p>The spreadsheets or statistical programs will likely mis-interpret
blank cells that you intend to be zeros. By not entering the value of
your observation, you are telling your computer to represent that data
as unknown or missing (null). This can cause problems with subsequent
calculations or analyses. For example, the average of a set of numbers
which includes a single null value is always null (because the
computer can’t guess the value of the missing observations). Because
of this, it’s very important to record zeros as zeros and truly
missing data as nulls.</p>
</div>
<div id="null" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Using problematic null values</h2>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: using -999 or other numerical values (or zero) to
represent missing data.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why null values get represented differently
within a dataset. Sometimes confusing null values are automatically
recorded from the measuring device. If that’s the case, there’s not
much you can do, but it can be addressed in data cleaning with a tool
like
<a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/">OpenRefine</a>
before analysis. Other times different null values are used to convey
different reasons why the data isn’t there. This is important
information to capture, but is in effect using one column to capture
two pieces of information. Like for <a href="dataorg.html#formatting">using formatting to convey
information</a>((#formatting) it would be good here to create a new
column like ‘data_missing’ and use that column to capture the
different reasons.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s a problem if unknown or missing data is
recorded as -999, 999, or 0.</p>
<p>Many statistical programs will not recognize that these are intended
to represent missing (null) values. How these values are interpreted
will depend on the software you use to analyze your data. It is
essential to use a clearly defined and consistent null indicator.</p>
<p>Blanks (most applications) and NA (for R) are good choices. White et
al, 2013, explain good choices for indicating null values for
different software applications in their article:</p>

<div id="formatting" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Using formatting to convey information</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: highlighting cells, rows or columns that should be
excluded from an analysis, leaving blank rows to indicate
separations in data.</p>
<p><img src="figs/formatting.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: create a new field to encode which data should be
excluded.</p>

<div id="formatting_pretty" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.2</span> Using formatting to make the data sheet look pretty</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: merging cells.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: If you’re not careful, formatting a worksheet to be more
aesthetically pleasing can compromise your computer’s ability to see
associations in the data. Merged cells will make your data unreadable
by statistics software. Consider restructuring your data in such a way
that you will not need to merge cells to organize your data.</p>
</div>
<div id="units" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.3</span> Placing comments or units in cells</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Your data was collected, in part, by a summer student who
you later found out was mis-identifying some of your species, some of
the time. You want a way to note these data are suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Most analysis software can’t see Excel or LibreOffice
comments, and would be confused by comments placed within your data
cells. As described above for formatting, create another field if you
need to add notes to cells. Similarly, don’t include units in cells:
ideally, all the measurements you place in one column should be in the
same unit, but if for some reason they aren’t, create another field
and specify the units the cell is in.</p>
</div>
<div id="info" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.4</span> Entering more than one piece of information in a cell</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You find one male, and one female of the same
species. You enter this as <code>1M</code>, <code>1F</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Don’t include more than one piece of information in a
cell. This will limit the ways in which you can analyze your data. If
you need both these measurements, design your data sheet to include
this information. For example, include one column for number of
individuals and a separate column for sex.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="field_name" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Using problematic field names</h2>
<p>Choose descriptive field names, but be careful not to include spaces,
numbers, or special characters of any kind. Spaces can be
misinterpreted by parsers that use whitespace as delimiters and some
programs don’t like field names that are text strings that start with
numbers.</p>
<p>Underscores (<code>_</code>) are a good alternative to spaces. Consider writing
names in camel case (like this: ExampleFileName) to improve
readability. Remember that abbreviations that make sense at the moment
may not be so obvious in 6 months, but don’t overdo it with names that
are excessively long. Including the units in the field names avoids
confusion and enables others to readily interpret your fields.</p>

<div id="special" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> Using special characters in data</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You treat your spreadsheet program as a word processor
when writing notes, for example copying data directly from Word or
other applications.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: This is a common strategy. For example, when writing
longer text in a cell, people often include line breaks, em-dashes,
etc in their spreadsheet. Also, when copying data in from
applications such as Word, formatting and fancy non-standard
characters (such as left- and right-aligned quotation marks) are
included. When exporting this data into a coding/statistical
environment or into a relational database, dangerous things may occur,
such as lines being cut in half and encoding errors being thrown.</p>
<p>General best practice is to avoid adding characters such as newlines,
tabs, and vertical tabs. In other words, treat a text cell as if it
were a simple web form that can only contain text and spaces.</p>
</div>
<div id="metadata" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Inclusion of metadata in data table</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You add a legend at the top or bottom of your data table
explaining column meaning, units, exceptions, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Recording data about your data (“metadata”) is
essential. You may be on intimate terms with your dataset while you
are collecting and analysing it, but the chances that you will still
remember that the variable “sglmemgp” means single member of group,
for example, or the exact algorithm you used to transform a variable
or create a derived one, after a few months, a year, or more are slim.</p>
<p>As well, there are many reasons other people may want to examine or
use your data - to understand your findings, to verify your findings,
to review your submitted publication, to replicate your results, to
design a similar study, or even to archive your data for access and
re-use by others. While digital data by definition are
machine-readable, understanding their meaning is a job for human
beings. The importance of documenting your data during the collection
and analysis phase of your research cannot be overestimated,
especially if your research is going to be part of the scholarly
record.</p>
<p>However, metadata should not be contained in the data file
itself. Unlike a table in a paper or a supplemental file, metadata (in
the form of legends) should not be included in a data file since this
information is not data, and including it can disrupt how computer
programs interpret your data file. Rather, metadata should be stored
as a separate file in the same directory as your data file, preferably
in plain text format with a name that clearly associates it with your
data file. Because metadata files are free text format, they also
allow you to encode comments, units, information about how null values
are encoded, etc. that are important to document but can disrupt the
formatting of your data file.</p>
<p>Additionally, file or database level metadata describes how files that
make up the dataset relate to each other; what format are they are in;
and whether they supercede or are superceded by previous files. A
folder-level readme.txt file is the classic way of accounting for all
the files and folders in a project.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Dates as data</h2>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are good approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets?</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives:
- Describe how dates are stored and formatted in spreadsheets.
- Describe the advantages of alternative date formatting in spreadsheets.
- Demonstrate best practices for entering dates in spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Keypoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treating dates as multiple pieces of data rather than one makes them
easier to handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dates in spreadsheets are stored in a single column. While this seems the
most natural way to record dates, it actually is not best
practice. A spreadsheet application will display the dates in a
seemingly correct way (to a human observer) but how it actually handles
and stores the dates may be problematic.</p>
<p>In particular, please remember that functions that are valid for a given
spreadsheet program (be it LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice,
Gnumeric, etc.) are usually guaranteed to be compatible only within the same
family of products. If you will later need to export the data and need to
conserve the timestamps, you are better off handling them using one of the solutions discussed below.</p>
<p>Additionally, Excel can <a href="https://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/gene-name-errors-and-excel-lessons-not-learned/">turn things that aren’t dates into dates</a>,
for example names or identifiers like MAR1, DEC1, OCT4. So if you’re avoiding the date format overall, it’s easier to identify these issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Challenge: pulling month, day and year out of dates</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>dates</code> tab of your spreadsheet you have the data from 2014 plot 3.
There’s a <code>Date collected</code> column.</li>
<li>Let’s extract month, day and year from the dates to new columns. For this we
can use the built in Excel functions</li>
</ul>
<p><code>YEAR()</code>
<code>MONTH()</code>
<code>DAY()</code></p>
<p>(Make sure the new column is formatted as a number and not as a date.)</p>
<p>You can see that even though you wanted the year to be 2014, your spreadsheet program
automatically interpreted it as 2015, the year you entered the data.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Challenge: pulling hour, minute and second out of the current time</p>
<p>Current time and date are best retrieved using the functions <code>NOW()</code>, which
returns the current date and time, and <code>TODAY()</code>, which returns the current
date. The results will be formatted according to your computer’s settings.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Extract the year, month and day from the current date and time string
returned by the <code>NOW()</code> function.</li>
<li>Calculate the current time using <code>NOW()-TODAY()</code>.</li>
<li>Extract the hour, minute and second from the current time using
functions <code>HOUR()</code>, <code>MINUTE()</code> and <code>SECOND()</code>.</li>
<li>Press <code>F9</code> to force the spreadsheet to recalculate the <code>NOW()</code> function,
and check that it has been updated.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
1) To get the year, type <code>=YEAR(NOW())</code> into any cell in your spreadsheet. To get the month, type <code>=MONTH(NOW())</code>. To get the day, type <code>=DAY(NOW())</code>.
2) Typing <code>=NOW()-TODAY()</code> will result in a decimal value that is not easily human parsable to a clock-based time. You will need to use the strategies in the third part of this challenge to convert this decimal value to readable time.
3) To extract the hour, type <code>=HOUR(NOW()-TODAY())</code> and similarly for minute and second.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="preferred-date-format" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.1</span> Preferred date format</h3>
<p>It is much safer to store dates with <a href="#day">YEAR, MONTH, DAY</a> in
separate columns or as <a href="#doy">YEAR and DAY-OF-YEAR</a> in separate
columns.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Excel is unable to parse dates from before 1899-12-31, and
will thus leave these untouched. If you’re mixing historic data from
before and after this date, Excel will translate only the post-1900
dates into its internal format, thus resulting in mixed data. If
you’re working with historic data, be extremely careful with your
dates!</p>
<p>Excel also entertains a second date system, the 1904 date system, as
the default in Excel for Macintosh. This system will assign a
different serial number than the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/214330/differences-between-the-1900-and-the-1904-date-system-in-excel">1900 date
system</a>. Because
of this, <a href="http://uc3.cdlib.org/2014/04/09/abandon-all-hope-ye-who-enter-dates-in-excel/">dates must be checked for accuracy when exporting data from
Excel</a>
(look for dates that are ~4 years off).</p>
</div>
<div id="data-formats-in-spreadsheets" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.2</span> Data formats in spreadsheets</h3>
<p>Spreadsheet programs have numerous “useful features” which allow them to handle dates in a variety of ways.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/5_excel_dates_1.jpg" alt="Many formats, many ambiguities" />
<p class="caption">Many formats, many ambiguities</p>
</div>
<p>But these “features” often allow ambiguity to creep into your data. Ideally, data should be as unambiguous as possible.</p>
<div id="dates-stored-as-integers" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.8.2.1</span> Dates stored as integers</h4>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that Excel stores dates as numbers - see the last column in the above figure. Essentially, it counts the days from a default of December 31, 1899, and thus stores July 2, 2014 as the serial number 41822.</p>
<p>(But wait. That’s the default on my version of Excel. We’ll get into how this can introduce problems down the line later in this lesson. )</p>
<p>This serial number thing can actually be useful in some circumstances. By using
the above functions we can easily add days, months or years to a given date.
Say you had a sampling plan where you needed to sample every thirty seven days.
In another cell, you could type:</p>
<pre><code>=B2+37</code></pre>
<p>And it would return</p>
<pre><code>8-Aug</code></pre>
<p>because it understands the date as a number <code>41822</code>, and <code>41822 + 37 = 41859</code>
which Excel interprets as August 8, 2014. It retains the format (for the most
part) of the cell that is being operated upon, (unless you did some sort of
formatting to the cell before, and then all bets are off). Month and year
rollovers are internally tracked and applied.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
Adding years and months and days is slightly trickier because we need to make
sure that we are adding the amount to the correct entity.</p>
<ul>
<li>First we extract the single entities (day, month or year)</li>
<li>We can then add values to to that</li>
<li>Finally the complete date string is reconstructed using the <code>DATE()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for dates, times are handled in a similar way; seconds can be directly
added but to add hour and minutes we need to make sure that we are adding
the quantities to the correct entities.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the many different ways Excel provides in how it displays dates. If you refer to the figure above, you’ll see that
there are many ways that ambiguity creeps into your data depending on the format you chose when you enter your data, and if you’re not
fully aware of which format you’re using, you can end up actually entering your data in a way that Excel will badly misinterpret.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>What happens to the dates in the “dates” tab of our workbook if we
save this sheet in Excel (in <code>csv</code> format) and then open the file in
a plain text editor (like TextEdit or Notepad)? What happens to the
dates if we then open the <code>csv</code> file in Excel?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click to the “dates” tab of the workbook and double-click on any of the values in the <code>Date collected</code> column. Notice that the dates display with the year 2015.</li>
<li>Select <code>File -&gt; Save As</code> in Excel and in the drop down menu for file format select <code>CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)</code>. Click <code>Save</code>.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up that says “This workbook cannot be saved in the selected file format because it contains multiple sheets.” Choose <code>Save Active Sheet</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the file in your finder application. Right click and select <code>Open With</code>. Choose a plain text editor application and view the file. Notice that the dates display as month/day without any year information.</li>
<li>Now right click on the file again and open with Excel. Notice that the dates display with the current year, not 2015.
As you can see, exporting data from Excel and then importing it back into Excel fundamentally changed the data!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
You will notice that when exporting into a text-based format (such as CSV), Excel will export its internal date integer instead of a useful value (that is, the dates will be represented as integer numbers). This can potentially lead to problems if you use other software to manipulate the file.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.3</span> Advantages of Alternative Date Formatting</h3>
<div id="storing-dates-as-year-month-day" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Storing dates as YEAR, MONTH, DAY</h4>
<p>Storing dates in YEAR, MONTH, DAY format helps remove this ambiguity. Let’s look at this issue a bit closer.</p>
<p>For instance this is a spreadsheet representing insect counts that were taken every few days over the summer, and things went something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/6_excel_dates_2.jpg" alt="So, so ambiguous, it’s even confusing Excel" />
<p class="caption">So, so ambiguous, it’s even confusing Excel</p>
</div>
<p>If Excel was to be believed, this person had been collecting bugs <strong>in the future</strong>. Now, we have no doubt this person is highly capable,
but I believe time travel was beyond even their grasp.</p>
<p>Entering dates in one cell is helpful but due to the fact that the spreadsheet programs may interpret and save the data in different ways
(doing that somewhat behind the scenes), there is a better practice.</p>
<p>In dealing with dates in spreadsheets, separate date data into separate fields (day, month, year), which will eliminate any chance of
ambiguity.</p>
</div>
<div id="storing-dates-as-year-day-of-year" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Storing dates as YEAR, DAY-OF-YEAR</h4>
<p>There is also another option. You can also store dates as year and day of year (DOY). Why? Because depending on your
question, this might be what’s useful to you, and there is practically no possibility for ambiguity creeping in.</p>
<p>Statistical models often incorporate year as a factor, or a categorical variable, rather than a numeric variable, to account for
year-to-year variation, and DOY can be used to measure the passage of time within a year.</p>
<p>So, can you convert all your dates into DOY format? Well, in Excel, here’s a useful guide:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/7_excel_dates_3.jpg" alt="Kill that ambiguity before it bites you!" />
<p class="caption">Kill that ambiguity before it bites you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="storing-dates-as-a-single-string" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Storing dates as a single string</h4>
<p>Another alternative could be to convert the date string
into a single string using the <code>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</code> format.
For example the date <code>March 24, 2015 17:25:35</code> would
become <code>20150324172535</code>, where:</p>
<pre><code>YYYY:   the full year, i.e. 2015
MM:     the month, i.e. 03
DD:     the day of month, i.e. 24
hh:     hour of day, i.e. 17
mm:     minutes, i.e. 25
ss:     seconds, i.e. 35</code></pre>
<p>Such strings will be correctly sorted in ascending or descending order, and by
knowing the format they can then be correctly processed by the receiving
software.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Data integrity</h2>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we carry out basic quality control and quality assurance in
spreadsheets?</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply quality control techniques to identify errors in spreadsheets
and limit incorrect data entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keypoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always copy your original spreadsheet file and work with a copy so
you don’t affect the raw data.</li>
<li>Use data validation to prevent accidentally entering invalid data.</li>
<li>Use sorting to check for invalid data.</li>
<li>Use conditional formatting (cautiously) to check for invalid data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have a well-structured data table, you can use several simple
techniques within your spreadsheet to ensure the data you enter is
free of errors. These approaches include techniques that are
implemented prior to entering data (quality assurance) and
techniques that are used after entering data to check for errors
(quality control).</p>
<div id="quality-assurance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.1</span> Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>Quality assurance stops bad data from ever being entered by checking to see if
values are valid during data entry. For example, if research is being conducted
at sites A, B, and C, then the value V (which is right next to B on the
keyboard) should never be entered. Likewise if one of the kinds of data being
collected is a count, only integers greater than or equal to zero should be
allowed.</p>
<p>To control the kind of data entered into a a spreadsheet we use Data Validation
(Excel) or Validity (Libre Office Calc), to set the values that can be entered
in each data column.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

values in the <code>Source</code> box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s try this out by setting the plot column in our spreadsheet to only allow
plot values that are integers between 1 and 24.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select the <code>plot_id</code> column</li>
<li>On the <code>Data</code> tab select <code>Data Validation</code></li>
<li>In the <code>Allow</code> box select <code>Whole number</code></li>
<li>Set the minimum and maximum values to 1 and 24.</li>
</ol>

<p class="caption">Image of Data Validation window for validating plot values</p>
</div>
<p>Now let’s try entering a new value in the plot column that isn’t a valid
plot. The spreadsheet stops us from entering the wrong value and asks us if we
would like to try again.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/invalid_value.png" alt="Image of error when trying to enter invalid data" />
<p class="caption">Image of error when trying to enter invalid data</p>

<p>You can also customize the resulting message to be more informative by entering
your own message in the <code>Input Message</code> tab</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/input_message.png" alt="Image of Input Message tab" />
<p class="caption">Image of Input Message tab</p>

<p>or allow invalid data to result in a warning rather than an error by modifying the <code>Style</code>
option on the <code>Error Alert</code> tab.</p>

<p>Quality assurance can make data entry easier as well as more robust. For
example, if you use a list of options to restrict data entry, the spreadsheet
will provide you with a drop-downlist of the available items. So, instead of
trying to remember how to spell <em>Dipodomys spectabilis</em>, you can select the
right option from the list.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.2</span> Quality Control</h3>
<p>Tip: <em>Before doing any quality control operations, save your original
file with the formulas and a name indicating it is the original
data. Create a separate file with appropriate naming and versioning,
and ensure your data is stored as values and not as formulas. Because
formulas refer to other cells, and you may be moving cells around, you
may compromise the integrity of your data if you do not take this
step!</em></p>
<p>README files: As you start manipulating your data files,
create a readMe document / text file to keep track of your files and
document your manipulations so that they may be easily understood and
replicated, either by your future self or by an independent
researcher. Your readMe file should document all of the files in your
data set (including documentation), describe their content and format,
and lay out the organizing principles of folders and subfolders. For
each of the separate files listed, it is a good idea to document the
manipulations or analyses that were carried out on those data.
<a href="https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme">Cornell University’s Research Data Management Service
Group</a> provides
detailed guidelines for how to write a good readMe file, along with an
adaptable template.</p>
<div id="sorting" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Sorting</h4>
<p>Bad values often sort to the bottom or top of the column. For example,
if your data should be numeric, then alphabetical and null data will
group at the ends of the sorted data. Sort your data by each field,
one at a time. Scan through each column, but pay the most attention to
the top and the bottom of a column. If your dataset is
well-structured and does not contain formulas, sorting should never
affect the integrity of your dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> to expand your sort in order to prevent data
corruption. Expanding your sort ensures that the all the data in one
row move together instead of only sorting a single column in
isolation. Sorting by only a single column will scramble your data -
a single row will no longer represent an individual observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>We’ve combined all of the tables from the messy data into a single table in a single tab. Download this semi-cleaned data file to your computer: <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/blob/gh-pages/data/survey_sorting_exercise.xlsx?raw=true">survey_sorting_exercise</a></p>
<p>Once downloaded, sort the <code>Weight_grams</code> column in your spreadsheet program from <code>Largest to Smallest</code>.</p>
<p>What do you notice?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Click the Sort button on the data tab in Excel. A pop-up will appear. Make sure you select <code>Expand the selection</code>.</p>
<p><img src="figs/sorting_button.png" /></p>
<p>The following window will display, choose the column you want to sort as well as the sort order.</p>
<p><img src="figs/sorting_example.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> how the odd values sort to the top and bottom of the tabular data.
The cells containing no data values sort to the bottom of the tabular data, while the cells where the letter “g” was included can be found towards the top. This is a powerful way to check your data for outliers and odd values.</p>

<div id="conditional-formatting" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.3</span> Conditional formatting</h3>
<p>Conditional formatting basically can do something like color code your values by some
criteria or lowest to highest. This makes it easy to scan your data for outliers.</p>
<p>Conditional formatting should be used with caution, but it can be a great way to flag inconsistent values when entering data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the main Excel menu bar, click <code>Format</code> &gt; <code>Conditional Formating...</code> Click the <code>+</code> to add a formatting rule.</li>
<li>Apply a <code>2-Color Scale</code> formatting rule with the lowest values set to orange and the highest values set to yellow.</li>
<li>Now we can scan through and different colors will stand out. Do you notice any strange values?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Cells that contain non-numerical values are not colored. This includes both the cells where the letter “g” was included and the empty cells.

<p>It is nice to do be able to do these scans in spreadsheets, but we
also can do these checks in a programming language like R or SQL.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.10</span> Exporting data</h2>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we export data from spreadsheets in a way that is useful for
downstream applications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store spreadsheet data in universal file formats.</li>
<li>Export data from a spreadsheet to a CSV file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keypoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data stored in common spreadsheet formats will often not be read
correctly into data analysis software, introducing errors into your
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Exporting data from spreadsheets to formats like CSV or TSV puts it
in a format that can be used consistently by most programs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Storing the data you’re going to work with for your analyses in Excel
default file format (<code>*.xls</code> or <code>*.xlsx</code> - depending on the Excel
version) isn’t a good idea. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because it is a proprietary format, and it is possible that in the
future, technology won’t exist (or will become sufficiently rare) to
make it inconvenient, if not impossible, to open the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Other spreadsheet software may not be able to open files saved in a
proprietary Excel format.</p></li>
<li><p>Different versions of Excel may handle data differently, leading to
inconsistencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, more journals and grant agencies are requiring you to
deposit your data in a data repository, and most of them don’t
accept Excel format. It needs to be in one of the formats discussed
below.</p></li>
<li><p>The above points also apply to other formats such as open data
formats used by LibreOffice / Open Office. These formats are not
static and do not get parsed the same way by different software
packages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of inconsistencies in data storage, do you remember how
we talked about how Excel stores dates earlier? It turns out that
there are multiple defaults for different versions of the software,
and you can switch between them all. So, say you’re compiling
Excel-stored data from multiple sources. There’s dates in each file-
Excel interprets them as their own internally consistent serial
numbers. When you combine the data, Excel will take the serial number
from the place you’re importing it from, and interpret it using the
rule set for the version of Excel you’re using. Essentially, you could
be adding errors to your data, and it wouldn’t necessarily be flagged
by any data cleaning methods if your ranges overlap.</p>
<p>Storing data in a universal, open, and static format will help deal
with this problem. Try tab-delimited (tab separated values or TSV) or
comma-delimited (comma separated values or CSV). CSV files are plain
text files where the columns are separated by commas, hence ‘comma
separated values’ or CSV. The advantage of a CSV file over an
Excel/SPSS/etc. file is that we can open and read a CSV file using
just about any software, including plain text editors like TextEdit or
NotePad. Data in a CSV file can also be easily imported into other
formats and environments, such as SQLite and R. We’re not tied to a
certain version of a certain expensive program when we work with CSV
files, so it’s a good format to work with for maximum portability and
endurance. Most spreadsheet programs can save to delimited text
formats like CSV easily, although they may give you a warning during
the file export.</p>
<p>To save a file you have opened in Excel in CSV format:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>From the top menu select ‘File’ and ‘Save as’.</li>
<li>In the ‘Format’ field, from the list, select ‘Comma Separated
Values’ (<code>*.csv</code>).</li>
<li>Double check the file name and the location where you want to save
it and hit ‘Save’.</li>
</ol>
<p>An important note for backwards compatibility: you can open CSV files
in Excel!</p>

<div id="a-note-on-cross-platform-operability" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>A Note on Cross-platform Operability</h4>
<p>By default, most coding and statistical environments expect UNIX-style
line endings (<code>\n</code>) as representing line breaks. However, Windows
uses an alternate line ending signifier (<code>\r\n</code>) by default for legacy
compatibility with Teletype-based systems.</p>
<p>As such, when exporting to CSV using Excel, your data in text format
will look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>data1,data21,24,5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When opening your CSV file in Excel again, it will parse it as
follows:</p>
<p><img width="307" alt="screen shot 2017-03-31 at 7 15 07 pm"
src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13110354/24560663/db4a5786-1643-11e7-931a-ca2c72336878.png"></p>
<p>However, if you open your CSV file on a different system that does not
parse the " it will interpret your CSV file differently:</p>
<p>Your data in text format then look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>data1 <br> data2br&gt; 1<br> 2br&gt; …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will then in turn parse as:</p>
<p><img width="308" alt="screen shot 2017-03-31 at 7 26 42 pm"
src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13110354/24561066/a990327c-1645-11e7-90b5-35a44e90f8d9.png"></p>
<p>thus causing terrible things to happen to your data. For example,
<code>2\r</code> is not a valid integer, and thus will throw an error (if you’re
lucky) when you attempt to operate on it in R or Python. Note that
this happens on Excel for OSX as well as Windows, due to legacy
Windows compatibility.</p>
<p>There are a handful of solutions for enforcing uniform UNIX-style line
endings on your exported CSV files:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When exporting from Excel, save as a “Windows comma separated
(.csv)” file</li>
<li><p>If you store your data file under version control using Git, edit
the <code>.git/config</code> file in your repository to automatically translate
<code>\r\n</code> line endings into <code>\n</code>. Add the following to the file (<a href="http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-30-excel-and-line-endings">see
the detailed
tutorial</a>):</p>
<pre><code>         [filter &quot;cr&quot;]
         clean = LC_CTYPE=C awk &#39;{printf(\&quot;%s\\n\&quot;, $0)}&#39; | LC_CTYPE=C tr &#39;\\r&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;
         smudge = tr &#39;\\n&#39; &#39;\\r&#39;`</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>and then create a file <code>.gitattributes</code> that contains the line:</p>
<pre><code>            *.csv filter=cr</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">

<div id="caveats-on-commas" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Caveats on commas</h4>
<p>In some datasets, the data values themselves may include commas
(,). In that case, the software which you use (including Excel) will
most likely incorrectly display the data in columns. This is because
the commas which are a part of the data values will be interpreted as
delimiters.</p>
<p>If you are working with data that contains commas, you likely will
need to use another delimiter when working in a spreadsheet. In this
case, consider using tabs as your delimiter and working with TSV
files. TSV files can be exported from spreadsheet programs in the same
way as CSV files. For more of a discussion on data formats and
potential issues with commas within datasets see <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/discuss/">the discussion

<p>A typical data analysis worflow is illustrated in figure
<a href="dataorg.html#fig:analysis">1.1</a>), where data is repeatedly tranformed, visualised,
modelled. This iteration is repeated multiple times until the data is
understood. In many real-life cases, however, most time is spend in
clearning up and preparing the data, rather than actually analysing
and understanding it.</p>
<p>An agile data analysis workflow, with several fast iteration of the
transform/visualise/model cycle are only feasible is the data is
formatted in a predictable way and one can reason on the data without
having to look at it and/or fix it.</p>
