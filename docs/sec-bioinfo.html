<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Bioinformatics</h1>
<p>As already alluded to earlier, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">Wikipedia defines</a> bioinformatics as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bioinformatics is as varied as biology itself, and ranges from data analysis, to software development, computational or statistical methodological development, more theoretical work, as well as any combination of these.</p>
<div id="omics-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Omics data</h2>
<p>So far, we have explored broad data science techniques in R. A widespread and successful area of bioinformatics, and one that you, as a biology or biomedical science student are likely to be confronted with, is the analysis and interpretation of omics data.</p>
<p>
<span class="marginnote shownote"> <!--
<div class="figure">--> <img src="figs/Centraldogma_nodetails.png" alt="Information flow in biological systems (Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology))."  /> <!--<span id="fig:infoflow"></span>
<p class="caption marginnote">-->Figure 8.1: Information flow in biological systems (Source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">Wikipedia</a>).<!--</p>--> <!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>It is useful to define these omics data along the flow of information in biology (Figure <a href="sec-bioinfo.html#fig:infoflow">8.1</a>), and define the different application domains. The technologies that focus on DNA, and the genome in particular (either whole or parts thereof) are termed <strong>genomics</strong>, and are currently based on sequencing, in particular high throughput sequencing (HTS). The domain focusing on the study of any DNA (or assiciated proteins) modification (such as for example methylation) is termed <strong>epigenetics</strong>. The study of RNA, and more specifically the quantitation of RNA levels in biological samples is termed <strong>transcriptomics</strong>, as it assays the transcription of DNA into RNA molecules. Without further specification, transcriptomics refers to the quantitation of message RNA, although one could also focus on non-coding RNAs such as micro RNAs. HTS is currently the technology of choice for any transcriptomics study, while a decade ago, prior to the development of RNA sequencing (called <strong>RNA-Seq</strong>), microarrays were widely used. <strong>Proteomics</strong> focuses on the identification and quantitation of proteins, and can also expand into the study of protein interactions, post-translational modifications or sub-cellular localisation of proteins. Further downstream of proteins, small molecules or lipids can also be assayed under the umbrella terms of <strong>metabolomics</strong> and <strong>lipidomics</strong>. The technology of choice for protein, lipids or smaller metabolites is mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>In the next couple of sections, some important concepts related to omics data and their analysis are repeated and emphasised.</p>
<div id="high-throughput" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>High throughput</h3>
<p>By it very nature, omics data is high throughput. The goal is to measure all, or as many as possible molecules of an omics-domain as possible: sequence the whole genome or all exomes; identify all epigenetic histone modifications (defining the compactness of DNA and hence it’s accessibility by the transcription machinery); identify and quantify as much as possible from the complete proteomics; etc. As a result, omics data is both large in size and complex in nature, and requires dedicated software and analysis methods to be processed, analysed to infer biologically relevant patterns.</p>
</div>
<div id="raw-and-processed-data" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Raw and processed data</h3>
<p>The omics data that are produced by the instruments are called raw data, and their size (generally large), the types of file, and structure will depend on the technology that is used. Raw data need to be processed using dedicated software before obtaining data that can be mapped to the biology that is measured. Below we illustrate two such examples using Sanger sequencing and mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>In Sanger sequencing, DNA is labelled using fluorophores, and different nucleotides are marked with different colours. Upon acquisition, light signal is acquired and recording of the different colours can be used to reconstruct the DNA sequence.</p>
<p>TODO add figure</p>
<p>In mass spectrometry, charged molecules are separated based on their mass-to-charge (M/Z) ratio and their intensities recorded to produce a spectrum. In proteomics, the molecules that are assayed are protein fragments called peptides. Upon fragmentation of peptides, the different between the M/Z peaks of the peptide fragment ions can be used to reconstruct the peptide sequence.</p>
<p>TODO add figure</p>
<p>Processed data themselves often need to be further transformed to account for a variety of noise that is inheritent to sample collection, preparation and measurement acquisition. Data processing and transformation will be explored in detail in subsequent course such as <em>Omics data analysis</em> (<a href="https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/WSBIM2122">WSBIM2122</a>).</p>

<div id="metadata-and-experimental-design" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Metadata and experimental design</h2>
<p>The acquired data, even once processed, is still of very little use when it comes to understanding biology. Before samples are collected and data are generated, it is essential to carefully design a question of interest (research hypothesis) and the experiement that will allow to answer it. For example, if we want to understand the effect of a particular drug on cancer cells, and more specifically understand the effect on the transcription of all the expressed genes, on would need to measure gene expression (using for example RNA-Seq) in cancer cells in presence and absence of that drug. The table below describes a simple experimental design where 3 conditions (control, drug at a concentrations of 1 and 5) have been simultaneously processed and measured by the same operator in triplicate.</p>
