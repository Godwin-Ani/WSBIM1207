## Local installation

This section describes how to install R, Rstudio, and a set of
important packages for the course.

1. Download R from the CRAN page:
   [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/). At
   the top of that page, choose the *Download R* link corresponding to
   your operating system. 
   
   If you use Windows, follow *install R for the first time*, then
   click the link to download R. The installation procedure is like
   any other software, and you can safely use all default options.
   
   If you use Mac (OS X), download the *pkg* installer that matches
   you OS version and install like any other software
   
   Linux users are advised to use their package manager.
   
2. Download and install the Rstudio Desktop Open source edition:
   [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Choose
   the installer for your operating system and version. Install as any
   other software.

3. Start Rstudio and install the following packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "remotes", "devtools"))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("UCLouvain-CBIO/rWSBIM1207")
```

If during any of the package installation steps, you get asked to
update some packages, for example with a message like 

```
Old packages: 'tinytex', 'TSP', 'tximeta', 'umap', 'vctrs', 'waveslim',
  'xcms', 'xlsx', 'xml2'
Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]: 
```

You can answer `a` to update all your packages.

## Using a cloud R/RStudio instance

An alternative to local installation is to use *virtual machines* that
run in the cloud. Here, we will use Renku platform provided by the
Swiss Data Science Center.

1. Create a new renku user - click to *Login - Sign up* button on
   [https://renkulab.io/](https://renkulab.io/), click *Register* at
   the bottom of the login screen and follow instructions. 
   
   Once completed, you will get to the following (or similar) screen.
   
```{r, fig.cap = "Renky labding page.", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/renku_screen1.png")
```
